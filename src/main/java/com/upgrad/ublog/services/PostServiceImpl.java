/**
 * TODO: 6.22. Implement the PostService interface and implement this class using the Singleton pattern.
 *  (Hint: Should have a private no-arg Constructor, a private static instance attribute of type
 *  PostServiceImpl and a public static getInstance() method which returns the instance attribute.)
 *   Note: getPostService() method of the ServiceFactory should return the PostServiceImpl object using
 *   getInstance() method of the PostServiceImpl class
 * TODO: 6.23. Provide an attribute of type PostDAO and instantiate it using the DAOFactory class.
 *  Note: You should not have any reference to PostDAOImpl in this class.
 * TODO: 6.24. Define the following methods and return null for each of them. You will provide a
 *  proper implementation for each of these methods, later in this project.
 *  a. getPostsByEmail()
 *  b. getPostsByTag()
 *  c. getAllTags()
 *  d. deletePost() (return false for this method for now)
 * TODO: 6.25. save() method should take post details as input and insert these details into
 *  the database using the create() method of PostDAO interface. Return the PostDTO object which
 *  was returned by the create() method.
 *  Note: The exception passed by DAO layer should not be passed to presentation layer. Print the stack
 *  trace corresponding to the exception passed by DAO layer and throw a new exception of type Exception
 *  with a message "Some unexpected error occurred!"

 *   the post using deleteById() method of PostDAO and return the same boolean value returned by the deleteById()
